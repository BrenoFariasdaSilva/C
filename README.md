```bash
$ sudo apt install build-essential
```

It will require your computer password, as well as a message asking for you to confirm the package installation.

If you are using VisualStudio, install the following extensions and then you are ready to code in C/C++

```bash
C/C++

```

**Windows**: If you are using **Windows**, just open [MinGW website](http://mingw-w64.org/doku.php/download) and download the version for your system. MinGW contains all the GCC Package you need.
After installing MinGW, open it and select to install the following packages:

Open it and click on "Environment Variables" then, on System Variables, click on "Path" and then click on "New" and paste the adress of MinGW bin folder. After that, restart your Computer.
